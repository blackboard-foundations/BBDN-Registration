                                <h3>Blackboard Data Explorers – Terms and Conditions</h3>
                                <p>
                                Blackboard Data Explorers (the “Program”) aims to equip Blackboard clients with the skills they need to make use of the Blackboard Data Developer interface, by providing hands-on experience of this interface using pre-built queries and a realistic demo experience. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                By registering for Blackboard Data Explorers hosted by Blackboard Inc. (“Blackboard”), you (“Participant”) agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions: 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Registration Restrictions: In order to register in the Program, you must be a member of staff at a Blackboard client institution that is licensing Learn, at the time of registration (“Participants”).  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Access to the Program: Once registered, Participants will have access to the Program, which includes a Blackboard Learn course containing resources, walkthrough videos and assessments, and a Demo Environment of Blackboard Data. Access to the Demo Environment will be limited for 60 days, starting on the day the Participant first accessed the Demo Environment. Participants may request to have this time limit extended by writing to <a href="mailto:data-explorers@blackboard.com">data-explorers@blackboard.com</a>. Blackboard will grant extensions at its sole discretion.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Program Badges: Participants can achieve the following two microcredentials, or “badges”, as part of the Program:  

                                <ul>
                                <li>Blackboard Data Navigator: Awarded to Participants that complete the first two chapters of the Program </li>

                                <li>Blackboard Data Explorer: Awarded to Participants who complete chapters 1 through 5 of the Program.  </li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                The Platform automatically grants badges to Participants who successfully complete the above-mentioned activities. In future, Blackboard may release additional activities and badges, and reserves the right to make changes to the activities in the course at any time. Available Badges and progress towards them will be shown under “My Badges” in the “Backpack” section of the course.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
